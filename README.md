### Notes/Thoughts

* To release Step 1 to production, where silly data could be entered, I would want it to handle such edge cases.
* If Price were included in a library, it should probably extend Numeric
* The customer is definitely going to want to know the breakdown, so we should really be printing an itemised receipt
